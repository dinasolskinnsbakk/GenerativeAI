# Goal

The goal for this project is to be able to remove a given furniture from a room and replace it with another specified furniture. This would be useful if you for example found a couch on Ikea and you would like to see how it would look in your room. You would then give the model a picture of your room where you want the furniture and an image of the furniture, and it would show you how it would look. To reach this goal, we will try different methods of varying complexity.
